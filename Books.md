# Book List

I am not good at reading technical books and struggle with studying long arduous technical content. 
While there are plenty of amazing foundational books that I could reference here I would like to compile a list of books that are short, concise and an easy read.

1. The Clean Coder - Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
2. Tidy First - Kent Beck
3. The Pragmatic Programmer - Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
4. Grokking Algorithms - Aditya Y Bhargava
